	<input id="enablePluginCheckbox" type="checkbox"/> <a href="#" id="enablePluginText">Enable/disable plugin.</a> 

	<p>
	The purpose of this plugin is to automatically click 
	the Like buttons on all of the websites that you browse.
	
	<p>
	It looks like this, when it is running:
	
	<p>
	<img src="what-it-does.png" alt="Timer counting down to click."/>

	<p>
	The red box with the number in it is a countdown timer, 
	which randomly waits between 5 and 60 seconds before it clicks the Like button.
	
	<h2>Am I Logged In?</h2>

	<div id="mustLogin" style="display: none;">
		<p>
		You need to make sure that you are logged into Facebook
		or this won't work. 

		<p>
		<a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Log in to Facebook now</a>
	</div>
	
	<div id="alreadyLoggedIn" style="display: none;">
		<p>
		Looks like you are already logged into Facebook, so
		this plugin should work.
